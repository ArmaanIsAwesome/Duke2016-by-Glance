# Duke2016 Facebook Messenger Chatbot README.md

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things you will need for this talk:

	1. NodeJS (install at https://nodejs.org/en/)
	2. NPM (Should come with NodeJS)
	3. Some sort of text editor (Im partial to Sublime but to each their own.)
	4. Facebook Developer Account (https://developers.facebook.com/)
	5. Facebook page where your chatbot will live. (Any page name will work! Have some fun with it)
	6. Localtunnel (install at https://localtunnel.github.io/www/)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today we are going to build an extremely simple chatbot on facebook messenger. We are going to use a pretty good open source framework to handle a lot of the heavy lifting. 

I struggled to get started building bots because of the lack of clear documentation so for every step in this process forgive me if notes seem excessive. For those of you more technically inclined keep in mind those who are not!

Tools we are using & what they do:
	
	NodeJS- to run our code. NodeJS is javascript on the backend. Regardless of your opinions on which langugages are best currently the best open source tools for chatbots are in javascript so deal with it :)

	NPM- Node package manager. Think of this kind of like the app store on an iphone. It makes it really easy to pull in cool stuff to use in NodeJS.

	Text Editor- This will be used to edit the code I provide (most of which is open source thanks to Howdy.AI)

	Facebook Developer Account - You need this to link your bot from running on your computer to hooking up to your facebook page you created.

	Facebook page- You hook your chatbot up to this. So when you visit "DukeBot" or whatever you named your bot you can get it to respond to you automatically.

	LocalTunnel- this is used to get secure callbacks approved on Facebook. If that doesn't make any sense just know it physically makes it possible for your code on your computer to connect to facebook. If that doesn't make sense just scream out loud bots suck and I will come help you!
